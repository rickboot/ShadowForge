TREASURE
The crystal orb is worth 25 gp. It can be used as an arcane
focus but is not magical.
32. HIDDEN TRAPDOOR
The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceiling
of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor set
into it. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side and
can be pushed open to reveal the den (area 3) above.
DEVELOPMENT
Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it remains
available to characters as a way into and out of
the dungeon level.
33. CULT LEADERS' DEN
The door in the southwest corner is a mimic in disguise.
Any creature that touches the door becomes adhered to
the creature, whereupon the mimic attacks. The mimic
also attacks if its takes any damage.
A chandelier is suspended above a table in the middle
of the room. Two high-backed chairs flank the table,
which has an empty clay jug and two clay flagons atop
it. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners, their candles
long since melted away.
34. CULT LEADERS' QUARTERS
This room contains a large wood-framed bed with a
rotted feather mattress, a wardrobe containing several
old robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate
containing thirty torches and a leather sack with fifteen
candles inside it. At the foot of the bed is an unlocked
wooden footlocker containing some gear and magic
items (see "Treasure" below).
Two ghasts (Gustav and Elisabeth Durst) are hidden
in cavities behind the earthen walls, marked X on the
map; they burst forth and attack if someone removes
one or more items from the footlocker. The ghasts wear
tattered black robes.
TREASURE
Characters searching the footlocker find a folded cloak
of protection, a small wooden coffer (unlocked) containing
four potions of healing, a chain shirt, a mess
kit, a flask of alchemist's fire, a bullseye lantern, a set
of thieves' tools, and a spellbook with a yellow leather
cover containing the following wizard spells:
1st level: disguise self, identify, mage armor, magic missile,
protection from evil and good
2nd level: darkvision, hold person, invisibility,
magic weapon
These items were taken from adventurers who were
drawn into Barovia, captured, and killed by the cult.
3 5. RELi UARY
The ghostly chant emanating from area 38 fills this
room. Characters can discern a dozen or so voices saying,
over and over, "He is the Ancient. He is the Land."
The cult amassed several "relics" that it used in its
rituals. These worthless items are stored in thirteen
niches along the walls:
A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a
goblin's hand) on a loop of rope
• A knife carved from a human bone
• A dagger with a rat's skull set into the pommel
An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a
nothic's eye
An aspergillum carved from bone
A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken
for a wand of polymorph)
A bag full of bat guano
A hag's severed finger
A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms
crossed over its chest
• An iron pendant adorned with a devil's face
The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf's withered
tongue
The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree
angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis
(area 37).
36. PRISON
The cultists shackled prisoners to the back walls of
alcoves here. The prisoners are long gone (their bones
litter the floor in area 27), but the rusty shackles remain.
SECRET DOOR
A secret door in the south wall can be found with a
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check and pulls
open to reveal area 38 beyond.
TREASURE
Hanging on the back wall of the cell marked X on the
map is a human skeleton clad in a tattered black robe.
The skeleton belongs to a cult member who questioned
the cult's blind devotion to Strahd. Characters who
search the skeleton find a gold ring (worth 25 gp) on one
of its bony fingers.
37. PORTCULLIS
This tunnel is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis that can
be forcibly lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
check. Otherwise, the portcullis can be raised or
lowered by turning a wooden wheel half-embedded in
the east wall of area 38. (The wheel is beyond the reach
of someone east of the portcullis.) The floor around the
portcullis is submerged under 2 feet of murky water.
38. RITUAL CHAMBER
The cult used to perform rituals in this sunken room.
The chanting heard throughout the dungeon originates
here, yet when the characters arrive, the.dungeon falls
.
silent �s the chanting mysteriously
stops.
